# DayZ_1_21_Custom_Loading

Use at your own risk.

Figured I would share with the community what I made work for our server. Not the best solution probably but it works for us. 

You can repack into your server packs and get it rolling. Just make the appropiate changes and make sure to copy the folders.

All of this will go into the 3_Game directory. 

Our structure was:

<br>
Mod<br>
<br>
->Scripts<br>
-->3_Game<br>
--->Custom_Loading_Screen.c<br>
<br>
->Layouts<br>
-->loading_disable_hints.layout<br>
-->loading_queue_disable_hints.layout<br>
-->timer_disable_hints.layout<br>
<br>
->Data<br>
-->hints.json<br>
